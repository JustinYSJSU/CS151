Main differences between int and Integer in Java
- int is a primitive type varible, Integer is a class
- int stores a value in memory, Integer convers int into an object or 
  and object into an int
- an int takes 32 bits to store, an Integer takes 128 bits
- int does not have any built in functions to change its value.
- Integer has multiple methods that can change its value. 
- Integer must be imported
- int can only allows the binary value of an integer

Advantages of int
- int takes less memory
- easier to use
- no import required (done implicitly) 

Advantages of Integer 
- access to methods that can change its value
- can parse values from Strings,etc
- allows more than just the binary value (hex, etc)

int specific functionalities 
- store just an integer, nothing else
- store int value in memory

Integer specific functionalities
- parsing from Strings
- comparing two values
- reversing values
